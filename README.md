# 5day-forecast

# Summary
This is a basic web application that allows the user to search for a city of their choice and in return will populate the page with current day weather and also the forecast for the next five days. Once the user enters a city a list will be generated of all previous searches. If the city searched UV-index is at a certain value font color will change accordingly to the danger of the UV-rays.
